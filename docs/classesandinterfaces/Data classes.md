## Data classes

Some autogenerated functions are converted to Swift: `copy` to `doCopy`, `equals` to `isEquals`, `toString` to `description`. Additional features, like destructuring, are not supported. 

### Explanations

Let's describe the usual data class in Kotlin:

```kotlin
data class DataClass(
    val param1: String,
    val param2: Int,
    val param3: Boolean
)
```

#### Function `copy`

The function copy is converted to Swift with the name `doCopy`, and works similarly to the function in Kotlin, but there is an inconvenience [with the need to specify all the function arguments](/docs/moreaboutfunctions/Functions%20with%20default%20arguments.md).

#### Function `equals`

Comparing two instances of a data class works similarly to Kotlin, including comparing collections. The equivalent function is `isEquals` in Swift.

#### Function `toString`

When using a data class object in a line, the output is the same as in Kotlin:

```swift
let data = DataClass(param1: "abc", param2: 123, param3: true)
print("data = \(data)")
```

The equivalent function is `description` in Swift.

#### Destructuring

This feature is not supported.
